A recorded criminal incident is a criminal event that may include multiple offences, alleged offenders and/or victims that is recorded on the LEAP database on a single date and at one location. The data spans the years ending March in the period of 2010 to 2019 and is aggregated to 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Local Government Areas (LGA).<br/><br/>\n\nThe CSA recorded crime collection includes all offences that are reported to, and detected by, Victoria Police and recorded on the LEAP database. The scope and coverage of the data, however, is not representative of all crime that occurs in Victoria. Some crimes may not be recorded on LEAP, not be reported to police, or the responsibility for responding to certain offences may lie with another agency. Recorded criminal incident data are compiled on the basis of the date that the incident was created on the LEAP database, rather than the date the incident was detected by, or reported to police. The creation date may not be the date when the incident occurred, or the date when the incident came to the attention of police.<br/><br/>\n\nFor further information about this dataset and related statistics, visit the data source:\n<a href=\"https://www.crimestatistics.vic.gov.au/about-the-data/explanatory-notes\" target=\"_blank\">Crime Statistics Australia</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nPlease note:\n<ul>\n<li>AURIN has spatially enabled the <a href=\"https://www.crimestatistics.vic.gov.au/crime-statisticslatest-crime-data/year-ending-31-march-2019\" target=\"_blank\">original data</a>.</li>\n<li>Recorded crime statistics are based on data extracted by Victoria police on the 18th day after the reference period, and are subject to movement between releases.</li>\n<li>The criminal incidents in the dataset are grouped according to the CSA offence classification.</li>\n<li>The data excludes criminal incidents recorded at Justice institutions and immigration facilities, Unincorporated Victoria and where the geographic location is unknown or outside of Victoria.</li>\n<li>To maintain confidentiality, sensitive criminal incident counts for subdivisions 'A10 Homicide and related offences' and 'A30 Sexual offences' with a value of 1 to 3 are given a value of 2 to calculate totals.</li>\n</ul>","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"reference_period","type":"String","title":"Reference Period","description":"The reference period.","stype":"ordinal","categories":[{"key":"2010","label":"2010"},{"key":"2011","label":"2011"},{"key":"2012","label":"2012"},{"key":"2013","label":"2013"},{"key":"2014","label":"2014"},{"key":"2015","label":"2015"},{"key":"2016","label":"2016"},{"key":"2017","label":"2017"},{"key":"2018","label":"2018"},{"key":"2019","label":"2019"}],"filterValue":"2019","isDimension":true},{"name":"lga_code11","type":"String","title":"LGA Code","description":"LGA code, based on ASGS 2011.","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"total_division_a_offences","type":"Integer","title":"Total offence count: (A)","description":"Total offence count: (A) Against the person.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"total_division_b_offences","type":"Integer","title":"Total offence count: (B)","description":"Total offence count: (B) Property and deception.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"total_division_c_offences","type":"Integer","title":"Total offence count: (C)","description":"Total offence count: (C) Drug offences.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"total_division_d_offences","type":"Integer","title":"Total offence count: (D)","description":"Total offence count: (D) Public order and security.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"total_division_e_offences","type":"Integer","title":"Total offence count: (E)","description":"Total offence count: (E) Justice procedures.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"total_division_f_offences","type":"Integer","title":"Total offence count: (F)","description":"Total offence count: (F) Other offences.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"lga_name11","type":"String","title":"LGA Name","description":"LGA name, based on ASGS 2011.","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false}],"filter":{"filterType":"tabular","spatial":{"bbox":[145.286940975,-37.975027801,145.878412014,-37.525996874]},"where":"(reference_period IN ('2019'))"}}
